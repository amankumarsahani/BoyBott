# Boy-Bott
Boy-Bott is similar to Discord bots. Discord bots are AI-driven tools that can help you automate tasks on your Discord server. They make it a lot easier to build a community that is truly engaged and can be used to moderate your server, welcome new members, or even ban people who are creating a bad environment for everyone else.
